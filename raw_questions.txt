**CHEM 101**

**Q:** What is a mole? [1 mark]
**A:** A mole is the SI base unit for measuring the amount of a substance. One mole contains exactly Avogadro's number (6.02214076×10²³) of elementary entities, which can be atoms, molecules, ions, or other specified particles. It provides a bridge between the macroscopic scale (grams) and the atomic/molecular scale.

**Q:** What is molar mass? [1 mark]
**A:** Molar mass is defined as the mass in grams of one mole of a given substance. It is numerically equal to the substance's relative atomic mass (for elements) or relative molecular mass (for compounds) when expressed in atomic mass units (amu). Its unit is grams per mole (g/mol).

**Q:** Define chemical equilibrium. [1 mark]
**A:** Chemical equilibrium is a dynamic state in a reversible chemical reaction where the rates of the forward and reverse reactions become equal. Consequently, the concentrations (or partial pressures) of the reactants and products remain constant over time, although molecular-level activity continues.

**Q:** What is the equilibrium constant? [1 mark]
**A:** The equilibrium constant (K) is a dimensionless number that quantifies the position of chemical equilibrium for a reversible reaction at a given temperature. It is calculated as the ratio of the product of the equilibrium concentrations (or pressures) of the products to that of the reactants, each raised to the power of their respective stoichiometric coefficients.

**Q:** Define half-life. [1 mark]
**A:** Half-life (t₁/₂) is the time required for the quantity (e.g., concentration, number of atoms) of a substance undergoing decay (typically radioactive decay or a first-order chemical reaction) to reduce to exactly one-half of its initial value.

**Q:** How does temperature affect equilibrium? [2 marks]
**A:** According to Le Chatelier's principle, a change in temperature will shift the equilibrium position to counteract that change. For an endothermic reaction (ΔH > 0), increasing temperature favors the forward reaction (product formation), increasing K. For an exothermic reaction (ΔH < 0), increasing temperature favors the reverse reaction (reactant formation), decreasing K. This occurs because temperature changes the relative rates of the forward and reverse reactions.

**Q:** State Le Chatelier’s principle. [2 marks]
**A:** Le Chatelier's principle states that if a dynamic system at equilibrium is subjected to a change in concentration, pressure, volume, or temperature, the equilibrium position will shift in the direction that tends to counteract or minimize the effect of that applied change. This shift occurs to re-establish a new state of equilibrium.

**Q:** Write the half-cell reaction for Zn/Zn²⁺ electrode. [2 marks]
**A:** The half-cell reaction for a standard Zn/Zn²⁺ electrode (which acts as an anode in a galvanic cell) is an oxidation reaction:
\[
\text{Zn (s)} \rightarrow \text{Zn}^{2+} \text{(aq)} + 2e^-
\]

**Q:** Explain oxidation state. [2 marks]
**A:** The oxidation state (or oxidation number) is a theoretical charge assigned to an atom within a molecule or ion. It is calculated assuming that all chemical bonds are purely ionic, with electrons completely transferred to the more electronegative atom. It is a crucial concept for identifying redox reactions, balancing chemical equations, and understanding oxidation (increase in oxidation state) and reduction (decrease in oxidation state) processes.

**Q:** What is a redox reaction? [2 marks]
**A:** A redox (reduction-oxidation) reaction is a chemical process involving the simultaneous transfer of electrons between chemical species. It consists of two complementary half-reactions: oxidation, where a species loses electrons (increase in oxidation state), and reduction, where a species gains those electrons (decrease in oxidation state). The substance oxidized is the reducing agent, and the substance reduced is the oxidizing agent.

**Q:** State Le Chatelier’s principle and explain its significance. [3 marks]
**A:** Le Chatelier's principle states that when a system in dynamic equilibrium is disturbed by a change in concentration, pressure, volume, or temperature, the equilibrium shifts in a direction that partially opposes the applied disturbance to establish a new equilibrium.
Its significance is profound in both theoretical and applied chemistry. It allows chemists to predict the qualitative effect of changing conditions on equilibrium systems. Industrially, this principle is strategically used to maximize the yield of desired products, such as in the Haber process for ammonia synthesis, by optimizing pressure, temperature, and reactant concentrations.

**Q:** Calculate the number of moles present in 22 g of CO₂. [3 marks]
**A:**
1. **Step 1: Determine the molar mass of CO₂.**
   Atomic mass of C = 12 g/mol, O = 16 g/mol.
   Molar mass of CO₂ = 12 + (2 × 16) = **44 g/mol**.
2. **Step 2: Apply the formula for number of moles.**
   Number of moles (n) = \(\frac{\text{Given mass}}{\text{Molar mass}}\).
   n = \(\frac{22 \text{ g}}{44 \text{ g/mol}}\).
3. **Step 3: Calculate and state the answer.**
   n = **0.5 moles**.
   Therefore, 22 g of CO₂ contains 0.5 moles of the substance.

**Q:** Explain the effect of change in concentration on chemical equilibrium. [3 marks]
**A:** According to Le Chatelier's principle, changing the concentration of a reactant or product disturbs the equilibrium. The system responds by shifting to minimize this change.
*   **Increasing reactant concentration:** The equilibrium shifts to the right (toward the products) to consume the excess reactants.
*   **Decreasing reactant concentration:** The equilibrium shifts to the left (toward the reactants) to produce more of the depleted reactants.
*   **Increasing product concentration:** The equilibrium shifts to the left to consume the excess products.
*   **Decreasing product concentration:** The equilibrium shifts to the right to form more products.
These shifts occur because the rate of one reaction (forward or reverse) becomes momentarily faster than the other until a new balance is achieved. The equilibrium constant (K) itself remains unchanged at constant temperature.

**Q:** Calculate the pH of a 0.01 M HCl solution. [3 marks]
**A:**
1. **Step 1: Recognize HCl as a strong acid.** It dissociates completely in water: HCl → H⁺ + Cl⁻. Therefore, [H⁺] = [HCl]₀ = 0.01 M.
2. **Step 2: Convert concentration to scientific notation for log calculation.**
   [H⁺] = 0.01 M = \(1 \times 10^{-2}\) M.
3. **Step 3: Apply the pH formula.** pH = -log₁₀[H⁺].
   pH = -log₁₀(\(1 \times 10^{-2}\)) = -(-2) = **2**.
   Thus, the pH of a 0.01 M HCl solution is 2.

**Q:** State Faraday’s first law of electrolysis. [3 marks]
**A:** Faraday’s first law of electrolysis states that the mass (m) of a substance deposited or liberated at an electrode during electrolysis is **directly proportional to the quantity of electric charge (Q)** that passes through the electrolyte.
Mathematically, it is expressed as: \( m \propto Q \) or \( m = Z \cdot Q \), where \( Z \) is the electrochemical equivalent of the substance (mass deposited per unit charge). Since charge \( Q = I \times t \) (current × time), the law can also be written as \( m \propto I \times t \).

**Q:** Explain electrochemical cells and their working. [3 marks]
**A:** An electrochemical cell is a device that converts chemical energy into electrical energy (galvanic/voltaic cell) or uses electrical energy to drive a non-spontaneous chemical reaction (electrolytic cell). A typical galvanic cell consists of two different metal electrodes (anode and cathode) immersed in their respective electrolyte solutions, connected by a salt bridge and an external wire.
*   **Working:** At the **anode**, oxidation occurs, releasing electrons into the external circuit. At the **cathode**, reduction occurs, consuming electrons from the circuit. This flow of electrons through the wire constitutes an electric current. The salt bridge maintains electrical neutrality by allowing ion migration. The overall cell reaction is a redox reaction, and the potential difference between the electrodes is the cell voltage.

**Q:** How can you determine the rate law of the following reaction? [5 marks]
**2NO(g) + O₂(g) → 2NO₂(g)**
**A:**
1. **Step 1: Write the general rate law.** For the reaction, the rate law is expressed as: Rate = \( k [NO]^x [O₂]^y \), where \( x \) and \( y \) are the orders with respect to NO and O₂, respectively, and must be determined experimentally. They are not necessarily equal to the stoichiometric coefficients (2 and 1).
2. **Step 2: Describe the method of initial rates.**
   *   Conduct a series of experiments where the initial concentrations of reactants are varied.
   *   In one set, keep [O₂] in large excess (so it remains nearly constant) and vary [NO]. Measure the initial rate for different [NO]. The relationship between rate and [NO] gives the order \( x \).
   *   In another set, keep [NO] in large excess and vary [O₂]. Measure the initial rate for different [O₂]. The relationship gives the order \( y \).
3. **Step 3: Calculate the orders and the constant.**
   *   Plot log(rate) vs. log[concentration] for each reactant. The slope of the line gives the order (\( x \) or \( y \)).
   *   Alternatively, take ratios of rates from two experiments where only one concentration changes. Solve for \( x \) or \( y \).
   *   Once \( x \) and \( y \) are known, substitute values from any experiment into the rate law to calculate the rate constant \( k \), including its units.

**Q:** For a certain reaction, a large fraction of molecules has energy more than the threshold energy, yet the rate of reaction is very slow. Why? [5 marks]
**A:**
A high fraction of molecules possessing energy above the threshold (activation energy, Eₐ) is a necessary but **not sufficient** condition for a fast reaction. According to collision theory, the reaction rate depends on two main factors:
1.  **Energy Factor:** The fraction of collisions with energy ≥ Eₐ.
2.  **Orientation (Steric) Factor:** The geometric alignment of the colliding molecules at the moment of impact.
In this scenario, even though the energy factor is favorable, the **orientation factor is likely very low**. The reacting molecules must collide with a specific spatial orientation that allows the necessary bonds to break and form. If the probability of a correctly oriented collision (an "effective collision") is extremely small, the reaction will proceed slowly despite sufficient energy. This is common in complex molecules or reactions involving specific geometric rearrangements.

**Q:** For a general reaction A → B, the plot of concentration of A vs time is given in Fig. [5 marks]
**(a) What is the order of the reaction?**
**(b) What is the slope of the curve?**
**(c) What is the unit of the rate constant?**
**A:**
**(a)** The graph of [A] vs. time (t) is a straight line with a negative slope. This is characteristic of a **zero-order reaction**. For a zero-order reaction, the rate is independent of the concentration of A, and the integrated rate law is [A]ₜ = [A]₀ - kt.
**(b)** The slope of the straight-line curve ( [A] vs. t ) is equal to **-k**, where \( k \) is the zero-order rate constant.
**(c)** For a zero-order reaction: Rate = \( k [A]^0 = k \). Since rate has units of concentration/time (e.g., mol L⁻¹ s⁻¹), the unit of the rate constant \( k \) is **mol L⁻¹ s⁻¹** (or M s⁻¹).

**Q:** The reaction between H₂(g) and O₂(g) is highly feasible yet allowing the gasses to stand at room temperature in the same vessel does not lead to the formation of water. Explain. Why does the rate of a reaction increase with a rise in temperature? [3+2 marks]
**A:**
**Part 1 (3 marks):** Although the formation of water from H₂ and O₂ is thermodynamically highly spontaneous (large negative ΔG), it does not occur at room temperature because of **kinetic control**. The reaction has a very high **activation energy (Eₐ)**. At room temperature, the average kinetic energy of the gas molecules is insufficient to overcome this energy barrier. Therefore, the probability of a successful, energy-sufficient collision is effectively zero, making the reaction rate imperceptibly slow. An external spark or catalyst is needed to provide the initial energy input to overcome Eₐ and initiate the chain reaction.
**Part 2 (2 marks):** The rate of a reaction increases with a rise in temperature primarily due to two reasons:
1.  **Increased Kinetic Energy:** As temperature rises, the average kinetic energy of the molecules increases. A much larger fraction of the molecular collisions now possesses energy equal to or greater than the activation energy (Eₐ), leading to a greater number of effective collisions per second.
2.  **Increased Collision Frequency:** While this factor is less significant, a temperature increase also slightly increases the frequency of collisions between molecules, further contributing to the increased reaction rate.

**Q:** Oxygen is available in plenty in air yet fuels do not burn by themselves at room temperature. Explain. [2 marks]
**A:** Combustion of fuels is a highly exothermic reaction but requires a significant initial input of energy known as the **activation energy (Eₐ)**. At room temperature, the thermal energy available to the fuel and oxygen molecules is insufficient to overcome this high activation energy barrier. Therefore, despite the presence of ample oxygen, the reaction cannot initiate spontaneously. An external source like a spark or flame is required to provide the necessary activation energy to start the combustion chain reaction.

**Q:** Why can we not determine the order of a chemical reaction by taking a balanced chemical equation into consideration? [5 marks]
**A:**
The order of a reaction is an **experimentally determined** quantity that describes the dependence of the reaction rate on the concentration of reactants. It **cannot** be reliably deduced from the stoichiometric coefficients of the balanced equation for several key reasons:
1.  **Mechanism vs. Stoichiometry:** Most reactions occur in multiple steps (a reaction mechanism). The overall balanced equation is a summary of the net change, not a description of the actual pathway.
2.  **The Rate-Determining Step (RDS):** The slowest step in the mechanism governs the overall rate. The rate law is written based on the molecularity (number of molecules involved) of this slow step, which may involve intermediates not present in the overall equation.
3.  **Example:** Consider the reaction:
    \( \text{KClO}_3 + 6\text{FeSO}_4 + 3\text{H}_2\text{SO}_4 \rightarrow \text{KCl} + 3\text{Fe}_2(\text{SO}_4)_3 + 3\text{H}_2\text{O} \)
    The sum of coefficients is 10, but the reaction is experimentally found to be **second order**. This clearly shows the order is not the sum of coefficients. It indicates a multi-step mechanism where the RDS involves only two reacting species.

**Q:** What happens to the most probable kinetic energy and the energy of activation with increase in temperature? [5 marks]
**A:**
*   **Effect on Most Probable Kinetic Energy:** The most probable kinetic energy is the energy possessed by the largest fraction of molecules in a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution. With an **increase in temperature**, the entire distribution curve shifts to the right and broadens. This means the **most probable kinetic energy increases**. However, because the curve also flattens, the **fraction of molecules** possessing that new, higher most probable energy is actually **smaller** than at the lower temperature.
*   **Effect on Activation Energy (Eₐ):** The **activation energy (Eₐ)** is a **fixed characteristic** of a specific reaction pathway. It represents the minimum energy barrier that must be overcome for a reaction to occur. **It does not change with temperature.** What changes with temperature is the **fraction of molecules** that possess kinetic energy equal to or greater than this fixed Eₐ. This fraction increases dramatically with temperature, leading to a higher reaction rate.

**Q:** Calculate the concentration of OH⁻ in a fruit juice which contains 2 × 10⁻³ M H₃O⁺ ion. Identify the nature of the solution. [5 marks]
**A:**
1.  **Step 1: Recall the ionic product of water.** \( K_w = [H_3O^+][OH^-] = 1.0 \times 10^{-14} \) at 25°C.
2.  **Step 2: Rearrange to find [OH⁻].** \( [OH^-] = \frac{K_w}{[H_3O^+]} \).
3.  **Step 3: Substitute the given value.**
    \( [OH^-] = \frac{1.0 \times 10^{-14}}{2 \times 10^{-3}} \).
4.  **Step 4: Calculate.**
    \( [OH^-] = 5.0 \times 10^{-12} \) M.
5.  **Step 5: Determine the nature of the solution.**
    Compare [H₃O⁺] and [OH⁻]:
    [H₃O⁺] = \( 2 \times 10^{-3} \) M >> \( 5.0 \times 10^{-12} \) M = [OH⁻].
    Since \( [H_3O^+] > [OH^-] \), the fruit juice is **acidic** in nature.

**Q:** Calculate the pH of 0.001M HCl solution. [5 marks]
**A:**
1.  **Step 1: Recognize HCl as a strong acid.** It dissociates completely: HCl + H₂O → H₃O⁺ + Cl⁻. Therefore, the primary source of [H₃O⁺] is the acid.
2.  **Step 2: Calculate [H₃O⁺] from HCl.**
    [H₃O⁺] from HCl = 0.001 M = \( 1.0 \times 10^{-3} \) M.
3.  **Step 3: Consider contribution from water autoionization.** The [H₃O⁺] from water is ~ \( 1.0 \times 10^{-7} \) M. Since \( 1.0 \times 10^{-3} \) >> \( 1.0 \times 10^{-7} \), the contribution from water is negligible (less than 0.01%).
4.  **Step 4: Apply pH formula.**
    pH = -log₁₀[H₃O⁺] = -log₁₀(\( 1.0 \times 10^{-3} \)).
5.  **Step 5: Calculate and state.**
    pH = -(-3) = **3**.
    Therefore, the pH of 0.001 M HCl is 3.

**Q:** Calculate the pH of 10⁻⁷ M HCl. [5 marks]
**A:**
1.  **Step 1: Identify the complication.** The acid concentration (10⁻⁷ M) is very low, comparable to the [H₃O⁺] from the autoionization of water (10⁻⁷ M). Therefore, the contribution from water **cannot be neglected**.
2.  **Step 2: Consider both sources of H₃O⁺.**
    *   From HCl: [H₃O⁺]_{HCl} = 10⁻⁷ M.
    *   From water autoionization: Let [H₃O⁺]_{water} = x M (which also equals [OH⁻] due to stoichiometry).
    The total [H₃O⁺] = (10⁻⁷ + x) M.
3.  **Step 3: Set up the equation using K_w.**
    \( K_w = [H_3O^+][OH^-] = (10^{-7} + x)(x) = 1.0 \times 10^{-14} \).
4.  **Step 4: Solve the quadratic equation.**
    \( x^2 + 10^{-7}x - 10^{-14} = 0 \).
    Using the quadratic formula: \( x = \frac{-10^{-7} \pm \sqrt{(10^{-7})^2 + 4 \times 10^{-14}}}{2} \).
    \( x = \frac{-10^{-7} \pm \sqrt{10^{-14} + 4 \times 10^{-14}}}{2} = \frac{-10^{-7} \pm \sqrt{5 \times 10^{-14}}}{2} \).
    \( x = \frac{-10^{-7} \pm 2.236 \times 10^{-7}}{2} \). Taking the positive root:
    \( x = \frac{1.236 \times 10^{-7}}{2} = 6.18 \times 10^{-8} \).
5.  **Step 5: Calculate total [H₃O⁺] and pH.**
    Total [H₃O⁺] = \( 10^{-7} + 6.18 \times 10^{-8} = 1.618 \times 10^{-7} \) M.
    pH = -log₁₀(1.618 × 10⁻⁷) = 7 - log₁₀(1.618) ≈ 7 - 0.209 = **6.79**.
    (Note: A simpler, commonly used approximation is [H₃O⁺] = 10⁻⁷ (from acid) + 10⁻⁷ (from water) = 2 × 10⁻⁷ M, giving pH = -log(2×10⁻⁷) ≈ 6.70).

**Q:** Calculate (i) degree of hydrolysis, (ii) the hydrolysis constant, and (iii) pH of 0.1M CH₃COONa solution (pKₐ for CH₃COOH is 4.74). [5 marks]
**A:**
CH₃COONa is a salt of a weak acid (CH₃COOH) and a strong base (NaOH). It undergoes anionic hydrolysis.
1.  **Step 1: Write the hydrolysis reaction and find K_h.**
    CH₃COO⁻(aq) + H₂O(l) ⇌ CH₃COOH(aq) + OH⁻(aq)
    Hydrolysis constant, \( K_h = \frac{K_w}{K_a} \).
    Given pKₐ = 4.74, so \( K_a = 10^{-4.74} = 1.82 \times 10^{-5} \).
    \( K_h = \frac{1.0 \times 10^{-14}}{1.82 \times 10^{-5}} = 5.49 \times 10^{-10} \).

2.  **Step 2: Calculate the degree of hydrolysis (h).**
    For a salt of weak acid and strong base, \( h = \sqrt{\frac{K_h}{C}} \), where C = 0.1 M.
    \( h = \sqrt{\frac{5.49 \times 10^{-10}}{0.1}} = \sqrt{5.49 \times 10^{-9}} \).
    \( h = 7.41 \times 10^{-5} \).

3.  **Step 3: Calculate [OH⁻] and then pH.**
    [OH⁻] = \( h \times C = (7.41 \times 10^{-5}) \times 0.1 = 7.41 \times 10^{-6} \) M.
    pOH = -log₁₀(7.41 × 10⁻⁶) = 6 - log₁₀(7.41) ≈ 6 - 0.87 = 5.13.
    pH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 5.13 = **8.87**.

**Summary:**
(i) Degree of hydrolysis, \( h = 7.41 \times 10^{-5} \)
(ii) Hydrolysis constant, \( K_h = 5.49 \times 10^{-10} \)
(iii) pH of 0.1 M CH₃COONa solution ≈ **8.87**
