The reacting molecules must collide with a specific spatial orientation that allows the necessary bonds to break and form.

    "exam_mode_answer": "**\\n**Part 1 (3 marks):** Although the formation of water from H₂ and O₂ is thermodynamically highly spontaneous (large negative ΔG), it does not occur at room temperature because of **kinetic control**. The reaction has a very high **activation energy (Eₐ)**. At room temperature, the average kinetic energy of the gas molecules is insufficient to overcome this energy barrier. Therefore, the probability of a successful, energy-sufficient collision is effectively zero, making the reaction rate imperceptibly slow. An external spark or catalyst is needed to provide the initial energy input to overcome Eₐ and initiate the chain reaction.\\n**Part 2 (2 marks):** The rate of a reaction increases with a rise in temperature primarily due to two reasons:\\n1.  **Increased Kinetic Energy:** As temperature rises, the average kinetic energy of the molecules increases. A much larger fraction of the molecular collisions now possesses energy equal to or greater than the activation energy (Eₐ), leading to a greater number of effective collisions per second.\\n2.  **Increased Collision Frequency:** While this factor is less significant, a temperature increase also slightly increases the frequency of collisions between molecules, further contributing to the increased reaction rate.",

It **cannot** be reliably deduced from the stoichiometric coefficients of the balanced equation for several key reasons:\\n1.  **Mechanism vs. Stoichiometry:** Most reactions occur in multiple steps (a reaction mechanism). The overall balanced equation is a summary of the net change, not a description of the actual pathway.\\n2.  **The Rate-Determining Step (RDS):** The slowest step in the mechanism governs the overall rate. The rate law is written based on the molecularity (number of molecules involved) of this slow step, which may involve intermediates not present in the overall equation.\\n3.  **Example:** Consider the reaction:\\n\\( \\text{KClO}_3 + 6\\text{FeSO}_4 + 3\\text{H}_2\\text{SO}_4 \\rightarrow \\text{KCl} + 3\\text{Fe}_2(\\text{SO}_4)_3 + 3\\text{H}_2\\text{O} \\)\\nThe sum of coefficients is 10, but the reaction is experimentally found to be **second order**.

With an **increase in temperature**, the entire distribution curve shifts to the right and broadens. This means the **most probable kinetic energy increases**. However, because the curve also flattens, the **fraction of molecules** possessing that new, higher most probable energy is actually **smaller** than at the lower temperature.\\n*   **Effect on Activation Energy (Eₐ):** The **activation energy (Eₐ)** is a **fixed characteristic** of a specific reaction pathway.

    "question": "Describe simple harmonic motion.",
    "exam_mode_answer": "** Simple harmonic motion is a type of periodic motion in which the restoring force is directly proportional to the displacement and acts towards the mean position. The motion is characterized by constant frequency and amplitude. Examples include oscillation of a spring and motion of a pendulum.",
