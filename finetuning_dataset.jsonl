The reaction has a very high **activation energy (E\u2090)**. At room temperature, the average kinetic energy of the gas molecules is insufficient to overcome this energy barrier.

A much larger fraction of the molecular collisions now possesses energy equal to or greater than the activation energy (E\u2090), leading to a greater number of effective collisions per second.\\n2.  **Increased Collision Frequency:** While this factor is less significant, a temperature increase also slightly increases the frequency of collisions between molecules, further contributing to the increased reaction rate. </s>"}\n{"text": "<s>[INST] You are an expert AI tutor for Kathmandu University.
